        <p class="art1-text">Hello! My name is Mario and I'm a second-year computer
          science student. I have grown to like frontend development, and I am selecting 
          coursework that will strengthen my frontend skills. Outside of school I like to go out with my friends, play video games, and read 
          manga.

        <h4>Due: Apr 13</h4> 
        <p>This project focuses on the presentation of rich media such as 
          audio and video. What makes this assignment different from a 
          typical audio or video web player is the media will be used to 
          control the UI to augment the content of the rich media.

          <p>Our first large project will be to create a custom image gallery. Before we can

            This media player will not only play audio and/or video files,

            page that displays data from each API in a way that makes sense and ideally
            connects each data set together in an interesting way.
